# T-Rex
A famous game built by google developers for google chrome offline mood. Just like that, I build a T-Rex game in Assembly Language x86 using masm611.

## This game has the following features:
1) The game starts with running of t-rex.
2) The user has to jump over the hurdles by pressing space bar.
3) The score will continously increasing with the running of t-rex.
4) The game is over with the display of high score.
5) The previous high score is replaced with new high score otherwise, the previous high score maintains its state.
6) you can quit the game by pressing 'q'.
7) The user can play again by pressing space bar when t-rex dies.

**How to run this game on your machine?**
1. Install DosBox.
2. Mount the dosbox in the Bin directory of masm611.
3. Paste the TRex.asm file in the Bin directory of masm611. 
3. Build the TRex.asm file in dosbox. Then run the TRex.exe file.
4. Another way is to simply paste the TRex.exe in Bin directory of masm611 and run through dosbox.
5. Enjoy playing TRex.
